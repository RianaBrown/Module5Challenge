# Module5Challenge

In this assignment I had apply what I've learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.

I was instructed to do the following:

Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

The files contained in this repo include data from a pharmaceutical company's (Pymaceuticals, INC.) most recent animal study. In their study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. In this repo you will also see my total and complete analysis of the data given.
